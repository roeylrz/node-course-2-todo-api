See file: playground\hashing for background.

npm i jsonwebtoken@7.1.9 --save
We will get two functions:
1. To create the token - jwt.sign
2. To verify the token - jwt.verify

jwt.sign //take the object, in this case the data with the user id and signed it. 
         //It creates the hash and then it ruturns the token value
jwt.verify//Takes the token and makes shure the data was not manipulated
//-----------------

1. Model methods - are called with User. for example - User.findByToken. 
   It doesn't exist in MONGOOSE and we need to custom create it
2. Instance methods - are called with individual user. for example - user.generateAuthToken
   We will use it in the - UserSchema.methods
